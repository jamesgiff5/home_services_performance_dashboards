### ‚öôÔ∏è Data Generation Summary

- Jobs generated between Jan 1, 2023 and Dec 31, 2024  
- Sundays and major US holidays excluded from job scheduling (to reflect typical residential service schedules)  
- Job volume simulated daily using a Poisson distribution  
- Each job assigned 1-4 services, priced by type and ZIP-tier multiplier:  
  - High ZIPs: +15% price  
  - Mid ZIPs: +5% price  
  - These increases simulate larger properties and higher service demands in premium neighborhoods  
- Service pricing ranges:  
  - Paver Sealing: $800-$3000  
  - Roof Cleaning: $300-$1500  
  - Others: $100-$800  
- Profit calculated per job using internal cost breakdowns  
- Nulls injected for realism:  
  - ~3-5% missing `crew_id`, `payment_delay_days`, `labor_cost`, `travel_cost`, `material_cost`
