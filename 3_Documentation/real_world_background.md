# üîç Real-World Business Background

Before transitioning into analytics, I ran an exterior cleaning business in Central Florida. The logic behind pricing, bundling, and seasonality in this dataset isn‚Äôt hypothetical. It‚Äôs modeled after the decisions I made to grow and manage a real service company.

The sections below highlight specific patterns I tracked in my business: what worked, what I adjusted, and how those insights shaped the way this dataset was structured.

## üè† Residential Strategy and Service Patterns

These decisions shaped how the dataset was structured, including bundling logic, ZIP-tier behavior, and seasonal load.

| **Metric Tracked**  | **Decision Made**   | **Outcome**   |
|----------------|------------------|---------------|
| Winter revenue dip         | Promoted paver sealing instead of washing in Nov/Dec           | Created a second seasonal spike, boosted Q4 load      |
| Slow Q1 bookings      | Ran pre-spring campaign in February         | Filled March/April ahead of time        |
| Low conversion on one-offs| Offered bundles with small discounts   | Increased average ticket size and profitability      |
| Strong Local Service Ads Performance  | Prioritized LSA after closing major commercial partner   | Drove 60%+ of annual revenue with minimal spend    |
| Weak Facebook ROI  | Cut spend, shifted to seasonal EDDM offers   | Improved lead quality and reduced cost  |
| Underused wealthy ZIPs     | Sent postcards to ZIPs with past success   | Increased residential jobs in high-margin areas              |

The repeat rate logic in the dataset reflects actual client behavior I tracked manually. Job bundling patterns were based on invoice data. Income tiers and ZIP regions mirrored how I priced homes differently depending on location, size, and complexity.

## üßæ Commercial Project Snapshot

While this dataset focuses on residential work, I also managed large commercial projects that required deeper planning, logistics, and adaptability.

| **Job Description**  | **Scope**   | **Duration** | **Key Challenge**  |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| Breezeway Cleaning     | 30 building community    | 6 days       | Manage water intrusion into units with poor weather seals          |
| Building + Breezeway Wash     | 11 buildings, 3 stories    | 6 days       | Prevent chemical overspray onto cars                               |
| Breezeway Cleaning            | 12 buildings, 3 stories    | 3 days       | Clean grime without damaging painted breezeway floors              |
| Parking Garage Cleaning       | 5-story garage, full surface cleaning     | 5 days       | Extremely limited water access, had to improvise supply            |
| Building Soft Wash            | 2 buildings, 5 stories     | 4 days       | Reached height limits of equipment                                 |

*These projects were completed during my final year in business, and the experience directly shaped how I modeled this dataset.*

Each job required custom coordination - adjusting for site access, weather, tenant needs, and equipment limits. I worked directly with referral partners, addressed property manager concerns, and adapted in real time to keep teams moving and clients satisfied.

These projects required fast decisions, coordination under pressure, and flexible planning, skills I now apply in data work. I had to operate with incomplete info, manage risks, and deliver on time. That mindset shaped every part of how this dataset was built.

## üß† How This Shaped the Data

- Bundling patterns were reverse-engineered from real invoices
- Seasonal volume modeled on actual demand surges and slumps
- Repeat rates reflect real customer rebook behavior
- ZIP-level income tiers were included to reflect how regional context can influence service planning, even though pricing was kept uniform in this simulation
- Imperfections like late payments and uneven costs were added intentionally to reflect real reporting challenges

This project isn‚Äôt just about building dashboards. It‚Äôs about structuring data to answer the kinds of decisions I used to make manually, now backed by analysis.
